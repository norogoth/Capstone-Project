This analyzes historical data to create projects for major-league baseball pitchers. The data it ships with goes up to the 2019 year. While this can be updated, no update is planned at the moment. If anyone wants to update this and submit a PR the data comes from [the Sean Lahman database](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=sean+lahman+baseball+db&ia=web).

## Usage Guide

To use this software, first compile and run the code. Then, type in a name of a pitcher and select the name from the menu below.

Then, you can look at the following historical trends for this pitcher, ERA, WHIP, K/9, K and cut chance. ERA will show the upper and lower standard deviation prediction for this pitcher as well.

However cut chance only shows up when projections are toggled to be on. You can toggle projections to be on by clicking the "Toggle Projection" button. This will show or hide projections based on historical data of how other historical pitchers progressed.
